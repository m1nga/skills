# Design Agent — Turn Visual References into Usable Interfaces

Design Agent helps a coding assistant carry visual references and feedback into a
specific design and a usable implementation. It keeps track of which choices are
accepted, what an interaction actually does, and what remains a prototype.

## When it fires

Use it to analyze a reference, establish a brand direction, refine an AI-generated
interface, or build an already scoped design. It does not automatically redesign
a site when you only ask for an opinion. For unrelated coding or marketing copy,
use the relevant workflow instead.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add m1nga/design-agent
```

Ask: `Use $design-agent with this reference. Preserve its color transition, then
redesign this page for desktop and mobile.`

The package contains instructions, not a background service. Image generation,
Figma, browsing, code execution and hosting depend on the tools in your environment.
TaskDock is useful for continued work but is optional; the skill explains the fallback.
No paid account is required merely to use the instructions. A new session may be
needed for an installed skill to appear in automatic discovery.

## What it does

- Reference observations separated from accepted choices.
- A visual direction or the implementation authorized by your request.
- Asset prompts with composition, cropping and motion constraints when needed.
- Focused revisions tied to visible problems.
- A handoff distinguishing working operations, simulations and untested behavior.

## Example

Input: “I like this reference's color transition. The rest isn't decided.
Show me a mobile and desktop direction. Don't build the app yet.”

Expected result: inspect the reference, explain the specific transition to borrow,
make a bounded visual comparison using the same content, and preserve the remaining
brand choices as proposals. No production app edits follow from that request.

Input: “Build the approved submission flow and make it reopen locally.”

Expected result: implement the actual submission behavior, check failure and recovery,
and verify a maintained entry after restarting the required services. If the agreed
deliverable is only a prototype, submission is labeled simulated.

These examples describe intended behavior; they are not claims of a deployed app.

## Design notes

A cinematic tutorial can teach composition and iteration without establishing
backend correctness or an approved brand direction. This skill preserves useful
methods—negative space, stable camera motion, media seams, specific revisions—and
avoids carrying a tutorial's palette, model version or promotional tactics into
every project. It also addresses a common delivery error: a success screen alone
does not show that a submission reached storage.

The review considered [Anthropic's frontend-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md)
for subject-grounded visual decisions and
[Vercel's web-design-guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)
for focused interface review. This package uses original wording and no copied code.

## Validation

Release checks validate package structure, reference links, metadata and installation.
Scenario walkthroughs cover intended requests, routing overlap, missing tools, stale
decisions and misleading success states. Walkthroughs are author simulations, not
independent user studies or proof of future model behavior. No visual taste, browser
compatibility or application backend is certified by installing this skill.
