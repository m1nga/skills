name: publish-skill-product
description: Publish a finished self-authored agent skill as a standalone GitHub product, or audit and repair an existing skill product page and its SEO/GEO discovery surface. Creates or updates problem-led metadata, a human product README with the origin story and evidence, the independent repository package, direct install path, and release verification; monitor mode detects committed skills that are new, changed, missing, or out of sync. Trigger when the user says a skill is ready and asks to publish/upload/release it, wants every skill to have its own GitHub page, asks to check or improve skill SEO/GEO/discoverability, or says 自动上传 skill / 发布到 GitHub / 每个 skill 单独产品页 / 监控新 skill. Do not trigger for exploratory skill ideas, third-party skills, generic git pushes, package-registry publishing, or unfinished/private work.

# Publish Skill Product

Turn one validated skill into one independently discoverable product, then prove the source,
product page, install package, and remote repository agree.

## Choose the mode

- **Release**: publish a new or materially updated skill after the owner marks it ready.
- **Audit**: inspect a named skill product without publishing unless the user also requests fixes.
- **Monitor repair**: consume a monitor finding, repair only confirmed drift, and record evidence.

Never treat a conversation ending as a release signal. Never publish private context,
third-party material, or an uncommitted draft.

## Start from the live release contract

1. Read repository instructions, status, remote, default branch, product manifest, and documented
   release commands.
2. Prefer the repository's existing publisher over reimplementing GitHub operations. For Ming's
   registry, use `/Users/m1nga/Desktop/ming-skills`, `products.json`,
   `scripts/verify-products`, and `scripts/publish-skill`.
   Outside Ming's registry, if no publisher exists, first confirm the repository owner, public
   target, and standing release policy; then build the smallest equivalent committed-source
   publisher rather than improvising a one-off working-tree copy.
3. Preserve unrelated dirty files. A release may include only the named skill, its product
   metadata, and release-system changes required for that skill.
4. Use committed source as the publication boundary unless the owner explicitly authorizes a
   working-tree release.

## Build the individual product page

Use [the product README template](assets/product-readme-template.md) as a completeness model, not
as mandatory boilerplate. Keep sections only when they add real information.

Make the page answer, in this order:

1. What human problem does this solve and what outcome does it produce?
2. When should someone use it, and when should they not?
3. What does the skill actually do?
4. How is it installed and invoked?
5. What does a realistic input-to-output example look like?
6. Why was it built this way? Use the owner's real incident or design constraint.
7. What evidence exists that it works? Separate tests, field use, and unverified claims.
8. Who made and maintains it?

Lead with the problem, not the author's collection, taxonomy, or biography. Keep authorship visible
but secondary. Do not invent a founder story, usage numbers, quotations, statistics, testimonials,
search rankings, or test results.

Read [SEO/GEO criteria](references/seo-geo-criteria.md) before writing or materially changing a
public product page. Treat discoverability as an evidence problem:

- use a problem-led H1, repository description, and focused topics;
- keep one primary intent per product repository;
- write unique first-hand content and extractable definitions, steps, comparisons, and evidence;
- cite primary sources only for factual claims that need outside support;
- avoid keyword variants, fake mentions, empty FAQs, and AI-search folklore;
- do not claim indexing or ranking until a live search proves it.

## Release the product

1. Validate `SKILL.md`, bundled resources, and `agents/openai.yaml`.
2. Run the repository's product-page audit. If none exists, run
   `scripts/audit_product_page.py <skill-dir> --product-manifest <manifest>` from this skill.
3. For a new public skill, run a trigger/body probe when `scenario-probe` is available. Fix release
   blockers before publishing; record only tests that actually ran.
4. Add or update manifest metadata: problem-led title, search-oriented description, and 3–20
   focused topics. Keep descriptions factual and normally 50–200 characters.
5. Commit and push only relevant source-registry changes.
6. Invoke the confirmed publisher. For Ming's registry:

   ```bash
   scripts/verify-products
   scripts/publish-skill <skill-name>
   ```

7. Verify the standalone repository is public and contains:
   - the product `README.md` at the repository root;
   - `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and every required bundled resource;
   - `LICENSE` and accurate repository metadata;
   - the canonical direct install command.
8. Run `npx skills add <owner>/<skill-name> --list` in a temporary directory and require exactly
   the intended skill to be discovered.
9. Check the repository's exact-name search result and skills directory presence. Record
   `not indexed yet` as a valid observation, not a release failure. Do not open third-party issues,
   request indexing, or create promotional posts without owner authority.

If `gh`, git authentication, the skills CLI, or live network access is unavailable, stop at the
last verified boundary and name every remote or install check that remains unproven.

## Run monitor repair safely

Use the monitor's persisted source cursor and remote evidence. For every detected product:

1. Classify it as `no-op`, `new-ready`, `changed-ready`, `source-dirty`, `remote-drift`,
   `metadata-drift`, `install-broken`, `not-indexed`, or `blocked`.
2. Deduplicate by skill name plus committed source tree hash.
3. Auto-repair only committed, ready, self-authored skills within the standing publication policy.
   In Ming's registry, a skill is monitor-ready only when its required files and `products.json`
   entry are present together on the upstream default branch; that manifest entry is the explicit
   release marker established by the repository contract.
4. Leave dirty or ambiguous skills untouched and report the exact blocker.
5. Verify the actuator by re-reading the remote repository and rerunning the relevant checks.
6. Advance the source cursor only after verification passes; a failed run must preserve the last
   good cursor.
7. Treat a no-change run as a successful, cheap no-op.

The monitoring loop may repair publication drift. It may not silently rewrite the product's
purpose, author story, claims, protected release policy, or the tests that define readiness.

## Report completion

Report separately:

- source commit and registry verification;
- standalone product URL and install verification;
- SEO/GEO changes actually made;
- current discovery evidence (`found`, `not found`, or `not checked`);
- skipped dirty work, pending third-party indexing, or authority still needed.

Never compress `published locally`, `pushed to the source registry`, and `verified as a standalone
product` into one claim.
